A simple observer implementation on POROs (Plain Old Ruby Object) and
ActiveRecord objects.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "voltage"
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install voltage

## Usage

You can use Voltage with PORO (Plain Old Ruby Object) and ActiveRecord.

### Plain Ruby

All you have to do is including the `Voltage` module. Then you can add listeners
and trigger events.

```ruby
class Status
  include Voltage

  def ready!
    emit(:ready)
  end
end

status = Status.new
status.before(:ready) { puts "Before the ready event!" }
status.on(:ready) { puts "I'm ready!" }
status.after(:ready) { puts "After the ready event!" }
status.ready!
#=> Before the ready event!
#=> I'm ready!
#=> After the ready event!
```

You can also pass objects that implement methods like `before_*`, `on_*` and
`after_*`.

```ruby
class MyListener
  def before_ready
    puts "Before the ready event!"
  end

  def on_ready
    puts "I'm ready!"
  end

  def after_ready
    puts "After the ready event!"
  end
end

Status.new
  .add_listener(MyListener.new)
  .ready!
#=> Before the ready event!
#=> I'm ready!
#=> After the ready event!
```

Executed blocks don't switch context. You always have to emit the object you're
interested in. The follow example uses `emit(:output, self)` to send the
`Contact` instance to all listeners.

```ruby
class Contact
  include Voltage

  attr_reader :name, :email

  def initialize(name, email)
    @name, @email = name, email
  end

  def output!
    emit(:output, self)
  end
end

contact = Contact.new('John Doe', 'john@example.org')
contact.on(:output) {|contact| puts contact.name, contact.email }
contact.output!
#=> John Doe
#=> john@example.org
```

You can provide arguments while emitting a voltage:

```ruby
class Arguments
  include Voltage
end

class MyListener
  def on_args(a, b)
    puts a, b
  end
end

Arguments.new
  .on(:args) {|a, b| puts a, b }
  .add_listener(MyListener.new)
  .emit(:args, 1, 2)
```

### ActiveRecord

You can use Voltage with ActiveRecord, which will give you some default events
like `:create`, `:update`, `:remove` and `:validation`.

```ruby
class Thing < ActiveRecord::Base
  include Voltage.active_record

  validates_presence_of :name
end

thing = Thing.new(:name => "Stuff")
thing.on(:create) {|thing| puts thing.updated_at, thing.name }
thing.on(:update) {|thing| puts thing.updated_at, thing.name }
thing.on(:remove) {|thing| puts thing.destroyed? }
thing.on(:validation) {|thing| p thing.errors.full_messages }

thing.save!
#=> 2013-01-26 10:32:39 -0200
#=> Stuff

thing.update_attributes(:name => "Updated stuff")
#=> 2013-01-26 10:33:11 -0200
#=> Updated stuff

thing.update_attributes(:name => nil)
#=> ["Name can't be blank"]

thing.destroy
#=> true
```

These are the available events:

- `before(:create)`: triggered before creating the record (record is valid).
- `on(:create)`: triggered after `before(:create)` event.
- `after(:create)`: triggered after the `on(:create)` event.
- `before(:update)`: triggered before updating the record (record is valid).
- `on(:update)`: triggered when the `before(:update)` event.
- `after(:update)`: triggered after the `on(:update)` event.
- `before(:remove)`: triggered before removing the record.
- `on(:remove)`: triggered after the `before(:remove)`.
- `after(:remove)`: triggered after the `on(:remove)` event.
- `before(:validation)`: triggered before validating record.
- `on(:validation)`: triggered when record is invalid.
- `after(:validation)`: triggered after validating record.

### Inside Rails

Although there's no special code for Rails, here's just an example of how you
can use it:

```ruby
class UsersController < ApplicationController
  def create
    @user = User.new(user_params)

    Signup.new(@user)
      .on(:success) { redirect_to login_path, notice: 'Welcome to MyApp!' }
      .on(:failure) { render :new }
      .call
  end
end
```

If you're using plain ActiveRecord, just do something like the following:

```ruby
class UsersController < ApplicationController
  def create
    @user = User.new(user_params)
    @user
      .on(:create) { redirect_to login_path, notice: 'Welcome to MyApp!' }
      .on(:validation) { render :new }
      .save
  end
end
```

### Voltage::Call

You can include `Voltage.call` instead, so you can have a common interface for
your observable object. This will add the `.call()` method to the target class,
which will delegate attributes to the observable's `initialize` method and call
its `call` method.

```ruby
class Contact
  include Voltage.call

  attr_reader :name, :email

  def initialize(name, email)
    @name, @email = name, email
  end

  def call
    emit(:output, self)
  end
end

Contact.call('John', 'john@example.com') do |o|
  o.on(:output) {|contact| puts contact }
end
```

Notice that you don't have to explicit call the instance's `call` method;
`Contact.call` will initialize the object with all the provided parameters and
call `Contact#call` after the block has been executed.

### Testing

`Voltage::Mock` can be helpful for most test situations where you don't want to
bring other mock libraries.

```ruby
require "voltage/mock"

class SomeTest < Minitest::Test
  def test_some_test
    mock = Voltage::Mock.new

    # Using listener
    sum = Sum.new
    sum.add_listener(mock)

    # Calling `mock.on(event_name)` is required because
    # the handler doesn't receive the event name, just the
    # arguments.
    sum = Sum.new
    sum.on(:result, &mock.on(:result))

    # Using with Voltage.call
    Sum.call(1, 2, &mock)

    assert mock.received?(:result)
    assert mock.received?(:result, times: 1)
    assert mock.received?(:result, with: [3])
    assert mock.received?(:result, with: ->(result) { result == 3 } )
  end
end

```
